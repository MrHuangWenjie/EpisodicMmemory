# EpisodicMmemory
It is an implementation of Global Workspace with episodic memory component. This is an incremental program, which would be continuously updated in the future with richer and richer cognitive capabilities. The main code files are factory.py and agent.py which are the networks and the modules respectively. It is impossible to upload the training dataset into this repository due to the large size. However, they would also be available if requested.

Currently, this is only for reviewer of the paper.
